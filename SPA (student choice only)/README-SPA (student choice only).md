SPA (student choice only) -- this folder includes both a .mod and and example .dat file, which enables student project allocation based on student preferences for projects, but taking into account maximum student capacities for staff and projects. A .dat file is required, which itself includes a list of student choices, projects (with a maximum quota of students for each, together with a Y/N representing whteher the rpoject is shared across more than one staff member or not) and staff (noting which projects are linked to each staff member and the maxmimum capacity for each staff member as well).
